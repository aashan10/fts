      "summary": "Never comfortable with \"her\" body or given name, Kayanna knew since childhood he was meant to be a boy. Struggling deeply with his identity throughout his youth, he adopted a new name - Krow.At 12-years-old, Krow began a career as a globe-trotting \"female\" fashion model. While living a glamorous lifestyle, he never felt fully comfortable, despite the attention and praise lavished on him for his good looks.At school he was seen as a tomboy and cruelly bullied for the way he dressed. Krow found solace in Animé conventions and cosplay, where he found like-minded people who accepted him for who he truly was, giving him new found confidence.At 18, Krow embarked on the journey towards physically becoming a man. The first step was cutting off his ponytail and then pausing his career as a fashion model in order to begin the process of transitioning.In a series of honest and often heart-breaking interviews, we see how Krow's decision impacted those closest to him. His mother, Lisa, initially struggles with the revelation that her child wanted to transition. But, as she learns what it means for him, she begins to whole-heartedly embrace her son's new life. Then there is Krow's friend Ashton and his mentor Kas who share their own experiences of growing up in bodies they never felt comfortable in, as well as their personal journeys towards transition.We witness the continual challenges faced by Krow, including hormone therapies and numerous invasive surgical procedures, such as breast removal and a hysterectomy.As Krow grows in confidence in his new body, he returns to his career in the fashion industry, taking his first job as a male model on the runway at Paris Fashion Week.",

      "summary": "1880. Sir Robert Cargrave, a London-based research physician, is known for his revolutionary work, mostly in what is considered the cutting edge treatment of paralysis. He rushes off immediately to the region of Gorslava on the central continent upon receiving a letter from a former love, Baroness Maude Sardonicus née Randall, in a request from her husband, the Baron, to meet him. Mr. Randall forbade Maude to marry Robert, he not yet having made a name for himself, in favor of someone of substance (i.e. with money), hence her marrying the Baron. The reason for Robert's haste in his reunion with Maude is her stating that her well-being is at stake. Upon arriving in Gorslava, Robert senses that the Baron evokes fear among those around him, and that even the Baron's faithful one-eyed servant, Krull, operates in that fear. Robert also learns that much of Krull's work is doing experimental research of his own on the Baron's directive, despite Krull having no background in such. The Baron is ultimately up front to him about the reason he summoned Robert. Beyond the threats he issues, the Baron displays a certainty that Robert will do what he wants. What Robert has to figure out is not what to do, but come up with a contingency if he fails in his task which will have major consequences for himself and Maude, whom he still loves.—Huggo",

      "summary": "The Interrupters tells the moving and surprising stories of three Violence Interrupters who try to protect their Chicago communities from the violence they once employed. From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn, persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period, the city was besieged by high-profile incidents, most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert, a Chicago High School student, whose death was caught on videotape. The film's main subjects work for an innovative organization, CeaseFire, which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases, and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source. The singular mission of the \"Violence Interrupters\" - who have credibility on the streets because of their own personal histories -- is to intervene in conflicts before they explode into violence. In The Interrupters, Ameena Matthews, whose father is Jeff Fort, one of the city's most notorious gang leaders, was herself a drug ring enforcer. But having children and finding solace in her Muslim faith pulled her off the streets and grounded her. In the wake of Derrion Albert's death, Ameena becomes a close confidante to his mother, and helps her through her grieving. Ameena, who is known among her colleagues for her fearlessness, befriends a feisty teenaged girl who reminds her of herself at that age. The film follows that friendship over the course of many months, as Ameena tries to nudge the troubled girl in the right direction. Cobe Williams, scarred by his father's murder, was in and out of prison, until he had had enough. His family - particularly a young son - helped him find his footing. Cobe disarms others with his humor and his general good nature. His most challenging moment comes when he has to confront a man so bent on revenge that Cobe has to pat him down to make sure he's put away his gun. Like Ameena, he gets deeply involved in the lives of those he encounters, including a teenaged boy just out of prison and a young man from his old neighborhood who's squatting in a foreclosed home. Eddie Bocanegra is haunted by a murder he committed when he was seventeen. His CeaseFire work is a part of his repentance for what he did. Eddie is most deeply disturbed by the aftereffects of the violence on children, and so he spends much of his time working with younger kids in an effort to both keep them off the streets and to get support to those who need it - including a 16-year-old girl whose brother died in her arms. Soulful and empathic, Eddie, who learned to paint in prison, teaches art to children, trying to warn them of the debilitating trauma experienced by those touched by the violence. The Interrupters follows Ameena, Cobe and Eddie as they go about their work, and while doing so reveals their own inspired journeys of hope and redemption. The film attempts to make sense of what CeaseFire's Tio Hardiman calls, simply, \"the madness\".—Kartemquin Films",

But when he goes to the village where his father had lived, the village folks strangely keep their guards up and seem quite uncomfortable around him. Hae-guk is invited to dinner by some village folks after his father's funeral. It seems the people are set on rushing him out of their village. Regardless, Hae-guk announces he won't be leaving for Seoul, but stay in the village. The people exchange mysterious looks. Then, the Chief (JUNG Jae-young) accepts and tells Hae-guk to settle down in the village. On Chief CHUN Yong-duk's orders, the village people suddenly start acting differently around Hae-guk. The Chief looks like a normal elderly man at a glance, but he is frighteningly charismatic, seems all knowing, and the village people appear to be following him like a god. Meanwhile, Hae-guk gets all the more suspicious of everyone in the village...—CJ Entertainment",

Show host, Taylor (Adam Rayner) handcuffs the contestants together, removes their belongings and sends them into the prison.The contestants find their way to the Warden's office, where they unlock themselves. Soon after, a TV monitor turns on, revealing an evil clown who warns the contestants of the Warden (Valentin Ganev) who used to work at the prison, before being sentenced to death for murdering inmates. Randall is set a task to travel to the chapel of the prison. With a microphone to communicate with the others, Randall ventures to the chapel and reads a prayer backwards to summon the spirit of the Warden. After completing his task, Randall returns to the others. Outside, the show's team, including Connie (Alexandra Staden), Sclezi (Sam Stockman), Big Daddy (Victor McGuire) and Snow (Sean Mcconaghy) begin to lose connection to some of the cameras inside the prison. Sclezi is sent in to fix them, however, he is stabbed in the eye by the Warden.Dixon is set a task, to remain lying in a hole in the ground. Once he is inside the hole, the Warden arrives and locks him in. Connie, Big Daddy and Snow see this, but believe the network had twisted the show to also make them contestants. They let the game continue. Shoe and Randall are set a challenge to eat a meat believed to be human flesh, which they complete. Toni and Stanton are sent to the gas chamber for their task. Stanton locks Toni in a chair in the gas chamber, and puts a gas mask on her. As the chamber fills with gas, Stanton is instructed to find the switch to stop the gas somewhere in the prison. When he leaves, the Warden appears in the chamber and removes Toni's mask. While Randall and Shoe make their way back to base, they come across the Warden, who stabs them to death. As Stanton turns off the gas, the Warden knocks him unconscious.Connie starts to become worried and sends Big Daddy and Taylor into the prison to check up on the contestants. They are soon attacked, and Connie attempts to warn Angel to get out of the prison. Angel believes this to be part of the game, as she has just been given the task to free Toni and Dixon. She enters a cell and finds a knife before the Warden appears with the key. She stabs him with what she thinks is a fake knife, and retrieves the key. She then finds Stanton hanging by his ankles in a cell, but before she can help him, the Warden stabs him in the neck and the abused inmates devour him.Angel flees, and runs into Connie, who has entered the prison. The Warden returns, and as Angel runs, the Warden catches up with Connie. As Connie prepares to be stabbed, two more Wardens, Shoe, Randall, Taylor and Big Daddy reveal the show was a set up, and Connie was the real contestant. After the initial shock, Connie is sent to retrieve Toni, Taylor to get Dixon, and the others to leave the prison. Taylor finds Dixon murdered in the hole, and Connie realizes Toni is dead. The Warden locks Connie in the gas chamber and gases her, while the others are sealed into the prison. Angel manages to escape out of the prison to Snow, having discovered people were being murdered by the real Warden. Snow follows Angel with his camera asking her for a final word; not knowing the rest of the cast and crew are trapped in the prison, Angel responds by breaking his camera.",

      "summary": "This film of \"Show Boat\" is more faithful to the original stage musical than any of the other films of it, except for the 1989 videotaped production presented on PBS.As the film begins, the Cotton Palace, a show boat on the Mississippi River, pulls into port. On board are the owner Cap'n Andy Hawks, his nagging, disapproving wife Parthy, and their eighteen-year old daughter Magnolia, along with their troupe of actors, singers, and dancers. Pete, the rough, coarse engineer of the towboat Mollie Able, which pushes the Cotton Palace, notices Queenie, the show boat's African-American cook, wearing a brooch that he had sent to the Cotton Palace's leading lady, Julie la Verne, in the hopes of seducing her away from her husband, Steve Baker, leading man of the company. Julie wants nothing to do with Pete and has given Queenie the brooch. Pete threatens Julie in front of her husband. A fistfight breaks out between Steve and Pete on the levee, just as Cap'n Andy is introducing his actors to the assembled crowd. Andy quickly pretends that Steve and Pete were merely acting out a scene from one of the plays performed by the company. Windy McLain, the pilot of the Mollie Able, notices that Pete has stolen Julie's photo out of its frame on the levee, where photos of the acting troupe are posted. The angry Parthy warns Julie to stay away from Magnolia, whom Julie loves as if she were a younger sister. Sadly, Julie tells Cap'n Andy that if she cannot see Magnolia, she cannot stay on the boat, but she does not resign or leave.After everyone exits, riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal passes by and sees Magnolia on the upper deck of the show boat. The two are instantly romantically attracted to each other. However, Ravenal must shortly leave to speak to the town judge about a personal matter.Later that day, the company is rehearsing the play they are to perform that night, when they are alerted by Ellie, the comedienne of the boat, that Pete is returning with the Sheriff. Windy also warns them that Pete has stolen Julie's picture and is up to something. Instantly, Steve, Julie's husband, takes out a menacing switchblade knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood. The Sheriff enters and announces that Julie is a half-black woman married to a white man, which is illegal. Steve, who is the white man, says that he is also part-black. Because he has sucked in some of Julie's blood, the troupe, especially Windy, a boyhood friend of the Sheriff's, backs Steve up, preventing the Sheriff from arresting Steve and Julie. But the couple, now that Julie's mixed blood has been revealed, can no longer act with the rest of the company, so they must leave. At this, Gaylord Ravenal, who also has been ordered to leave town, reappears and asks for passage on the boat. Cap'n Andy, realizing the handsome Ravenal's potential as an actor, hires him as leading man, and over Parthy's objections, makes Magnolia the new leading lady. Magnolia tearfully says goodbye to Julie, who sadly leaves with her husband, but not before hearing Cap'n Andy make Magnolia the new leading lady and Ravenal the new leading man. Pete is fired offscreen.Weeks pass, and by now, Magnolia and Ravenal have fallen in love. Parthy is determined to get the goods on Ravenal, and temporarily leaves town. While she is gone, Ravenal proposes to Magnolia and the two make plans to marry. Just as they are about to enter the church, Parthy returns and announces that Ravenal killed a man years ago - this is why he can never stay in town for very long - but the Sheriff says that it was self-defense, so Parthy is powerless to do anything. Magnolia and Ravenal are married.More time passes, and the happy couple has a baby daughter, whom they name Kim. They leave the boat and go to live in Chicago, where they are alternately rich and broke, depending on Ravenal's luck at gambling (he does not work). One day, while they are living in a second rate boarding house, Magnolia runs into Ellie and her husband Frank Shultz, who have left the show boat and have been booked into the Trocadero, a Chicago nightclub. Then someone brings a letter, which turns out to be a farewell note from Ravenal, who has decided to leave Magnolia out of guilt for his inability to support her. Frank and Ellie take the devastated Magnolia to the Trocadero, where Magnolia hopes to find a job. But she does not know that the featured singer is Julie, the same Julie from the show boat, who has become an alcoholic now that Steve has left her. From her dressing room, Julie overhears Magnolia audition, and realizing that she needs the job, abruptly quits so that the manager will have no choice but to hire Magnolia, who never learns of Julie's generous sacrifice, or even that she once worked there.On New Year's Eve, Cap'n Andy and Parthy arrive in Chicago for a surprise visit, but are unable to find Magnolia and Ravenal because they are no longer living in a fancy hotel. Andy decides to go celebrate New Year's Eve alone and ends up (a little tipsy) at the Trocadero, where he discovers Magnolia singing. When she falters due to stage fright, he encourages her and she becomes a hit and goes on to a successful international career. She raises her daughter all alone.More time passes and we see Ravenal's hands pasting newspaper clippings about Magnolia into a scrapbook. He is either living or staying in another second-rate boarding house. It is now about thirty years later. Magnolia, now about sixty, is retiring from the stage. Her daughter Kim has become a musical star and is about to play her first leading role on Broadway. She does not realize that the shabbily dressed theatre doorman, whom she knows only as \"Pop\", is in reality her own father, Gaylord Ravenal. He is fired for trying to watch the performance just as Magnolia, Cap'n Andy, and Parthy arrive (they have come all the way from Mississippi to see Kim's starring debut). Magnolia sees Ravenal and invites him to sit with them, and the theatre manager, who has learned the truth, allows him to do so. After the show ends, Kim asks her mother to sing an encore. Ravenal joins her in song, Kim is moved to tears, and Magnolia and Ravenal are reconciled.",
